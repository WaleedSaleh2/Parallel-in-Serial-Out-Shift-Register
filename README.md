# Parallel-in-Serial-Out-Shift-Register

## Find Top-10 Numbers in an Input Stream from the input.txt file and store them in the output.txt file

This Project is to design a digital circuit that can find the highest 1- numbers in a stream of numbers passed serially to the  circuitâ€”the circuit consists of an array of Processing Elements (PEs) and a paralleled-in Serial-out shift register. This project was done by using VHDL language and FPGAs. The software used in this project is (Quartes 20.1).



* VHDL shift-register
* Parallel-in Serial-out Shift Register
